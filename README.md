# Team Learning Journal: CMS_Practical_7 - Assignment 2 Version 1

## Learning Journal: Building a Website with PHP, CSS, and JavaScript on XAMPP localhost WordPress

### Learning Activities & Resources

As a team, we initiated our website development project by collectively setting up essential tools, including Trello, Slack, and GitHub. Leveraging insightful online guides and videos facilitated a smooth setup process, allowing us to navigate the initial stages with relative ease.

In the subsequent phase, our focus shifted to establishing seamless connections between Trello, GitHub, and Slack. This collaborative effort resembled constructing a bridge that linked these diverse platforms. The integration proved pivotal, enabling us to monitor tasks effortlessly and receive real-time updates on code changes within our team chat on Slack. This synergistic approach created a more streamlined and efficient collaborative environment for the entire team.

The current state of the website serves as a dynamic template, a collective canvas upon which we experiment with design elements, functionalities, and user interactions. This prototype approach allows us to test ideas, identify potential improvements, and collectively validate the overall concept before committing to final development.

Contributions from each team member involved populating our Trello board with foundational information, outlining project goals and tasks. Simultaneously, each team member actively contributed code to our shared GitHub repository. This collaborative phase felt akin to laying the groundwork for a construction project, and we eagerly anticipate witnessing the project evolve further as a cohesive unit.

### Estimated Hours

Up to this point, we've collectively invested around 5 hours in the setup and integration process. Despite encountering slight learning curves initially, our proficiency is steadily increasing as a team. Looking ahead, we anticipate dedicating another 5-10 hours collectively this week to finalize the organization of our project, ensuring it's fully prepared for launch.

### Content Insight

Our Trello board functions as a visual roadmap for our project, delineating sections for tasks, ideas, and feedback. It serves as an invaluable tool to grasp the entirety of the project at a glance, fostering alignment within the team.

The GitHub repository acts as a digital library, securely housing our code files and facilitating seamless collaboration. It serves as a safeguard for our project's critical assets, collectively managed by the team.

Meanwhile, Slack operates as our virtual team room—a central hub for communication, updates, and queries. Its functionality proves crucial in maintaining connectivity, particularly in a remote working setup where effective communication is vital.

### Analytics using SMART rules

- **Specific:** Tasks on our Trello board have explicit deadlines and designated team members, ensuring clarity in our collective goals.
- **Measurable:** Progress is tracked through completed tasks and the frequency of code updates, providing tangible indicators of our collaborative efforts.
- **Achievable:** Our goals, collectively set, are ambitious yet realistic, broken down into manageable steps that each team member can contribute to.
- **Relevant:** The selected tools align directly with our project's needs, ensuring efficiency in goal attainment and collective success.
- **Time-bound:** Set deadlines for each project phase ensure adherence to the timeline and meeting established targets, collectively driving our progress forward.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This collective experience is proving instrumental for each team member in acquiring valuable skills related to project management, collaboration, and version control—essential competencies in the ever-evolving tech landscape. The prospect of adding these skills to our professional toolkits collectively is genuinely exciting.

Collaborating on this project as a team is contributing significantly to our communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills—attributes transferrable to any workplace scenario. The adaptability of each team member is a key takeaway, with the understanding that technological landscapes continually shift. Learning to navigate new tools and workflows collectively is not just an asset but a necessity, and this experience is honing our adaptability and versatility as learners.

### Why XAMPP as Local Host

One may wonder why we chose XAMPP as the local host for this project. XAMPP, an acronym for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P), provides a comprehensive and user-friendly environment for web development. The decision to use XAMPP collectively is rooted in its ease of setup, which consolidates essential components like Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP interpreter. This all-in-one package significantly simplifies the local hosting process, allowing for seamless development and testing of PHP-based web applications. XAMPP serves as a reliable and efficient local server solution, facilitating a realistic development environment before deploying the website to a live server.

### Why PHP, CSS, and JavaScript

The strategic choice of PHP, CSS, and JavaScript is a collective decision based on their individual strengths:

- **PHP:** Renowned for server-side scripting, seamlessly integrating with databases like MySQL, aligning perfectly with the project's requirements.
- **CSS:** Indispensable for enhancing visual appeal, enabling precise styling and formatting collectively to ensure a polished and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamism to web pages, crucial for an engaging user experience. Collectively, JavaScript will be utilized to introduce interactive elements, ensuring a more engaging and dynamic website.
